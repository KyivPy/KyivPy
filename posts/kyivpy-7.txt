Hi all.
Next Kyiv.py will take place at June, 9 at the Ciklum Kyiv HQ.

We have 2 confirmed talks already:

* Igor Davydenko (oDesk) will have a talk named "Me and Django: yesterday, today, tomorrow"

* Vasyl Dizhak (Djangostars) will have a talk about advanced patterns in Git.

If you have something interesting to share with the pythonistas - do not hesitate to write to the gotsyk at gmail.com or contact me in twitter @gotsyk or @uapycon.

âš  Warning: It is Euro-2012 time in Ukraine. So, please, think about the tickets to Kyiv if you are coming from another city in advance.
